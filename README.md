# Machina_Labs_Robotic_HW
This is my submission for the Machina Labs robotic homework.

## Overview
My solution contains two packages, `robotic_hw_interfaces` and `robotic_hw`.

`robotic_hw_interfaces` contains the custom interfaces (services and messages) needed for my solution.
* `srv/GetLoadCellData.srv` contains the definition of the service for the 3-DOF sensor.
* `msg/LoadCellData.msg` defines a message containing information about a 3-DOF sensor measurement.
* `msg/LoadCellDataArray.msg` defines the message published by the publisher node. It is an array because the publisher requests data from multiple servers and aggregates them into one topic.

`robotic_hw` contains the implementation of my server and publisher nodes, as well as launch files for convenience.
* `robotic_hw/load_cell_data_server.py` is a node which requests data from a load cell through a socket. It exposes this data through a ROS2 service.
  * The server is robust and will attempt to periodically reconnect if the load cell socket disconnects.
  * The socket IP, port and number of samples to request are parameters of the node.
  * Since the assignment mentions filtered data, a simple lowpass filter is applied by averaging the received samples into one filtered sample.
* `robotic_hw/load_cell_data_publisher.py` is a node which requests load cell data from multiple services and combines them into an array which is published at 500 Hz.
  * The publisher takes a list of services as parameter, so it can easily scale to any number of sensors and services.
  * Publishing frequency (500 Hz) and service request frequency are also parameters of the node.
  * The aggregated data is published as a LoadCellDataArray message to the `/load_cells` topic.

## Usage
This repository can be cloned directly into a ROS2 workspace. 
In addition to standard ROS2 libraries, the only additional dependency is `numpy`.
To build, you can run `colcon build` in the workspace root. The package then must be sourced from the install directory.
To run the code, you can use the launch files defined in the `robotic_hw` package.

Launch Files
  * `launch/two_sensors.launch.py` launches two servers and one publisher.
  * `launch/simulator.launch.py` launches the sensor simulator script, `sensor.py`.
  * `launch/two_sensors_simulated.launch.py` launches both of those launch files, starting the simulator and the nodes.

# Original Assignment

## Context
The design of our cells in Machina Labs has evolved over the past years. Currently, each of our cells has two articulated industrial robots on rails (a total of 7 axes) and a frame with hydraulic clamps. For the parts to form correctly, we must exert and maintain a dynamic force during the forming in a very accurate location in space. Currently, each robot is equipped with a load cell. See a quick video about our process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqYMprTEXRI). We are using ROS2 to collect the data from the network and control the robots in real-time. As a robotic engineer, we keep developing different modules for our network to add features to the system.  
 
## Objective
The goal of This project is to build a ROS2 network that collects data from 3-DOF sensors and makes the filtered data available as a ROS service and topic. Since we cannot send a real sensor to all of our applicants, we made a simple simulator (sensor.py) that mimics the behavior of a real sensor but with random data. 
- The first task is to make a custom service for 3-DOF sensor 
- The second task is to make a ROS2 service server that continuously reads data from the sensor and has the latest filter data available for the client service that you make. 
- Finally, please make a simple client that calls two of these services and publishes them to a topic at 500Hz. Please keep in mind that your service servers can run slower than 500Hz. 
- You can define a second server in the simulator to modify the code and run two at the same time.
- You can check the example.py to see how to make calls to the sensor

## Grading Criteria
- Weâ€™re looking for code that is clean, readable, performant, and maintainable.
- The developer must think through the process of deploying and using the solution and provide the necessary documentation. 
- The sensor samples with 2000Hz, and you can request a specific number of samples in each call. Each call also has a ~1ms delay on top of the sampling time. We would like to hear your thought on picking the number of samples that you read in each call.
